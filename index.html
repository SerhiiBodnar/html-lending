                    <p>The Ford F-Series is a series of light-duty trucks marketed and manufactured by Ford since the
                        1948 model year. Slotted above the Ford Ranger in the Ford truck model range, the F-Series is
                        marketed as a range of full-sized pickup trucks. Since 1977, the F-Series has remained the
                        best-selling pickup truck line in the United States; it has been the highest-selling vehicle
                        overall since 1981.</p>

                    <p>The Toyota Tundra is a pickup truck manufactured in the United States by the Japanese
                        manufacturer Toyota since May 1999. The Tundra was the second full-size pickup to be built by a
                        Japanese manufacturer (the first was the Toyota T100), but the Tundra was the first full-size
                        pickup from a Japanese manufacturer to be built in North America.</p>

                    <p>The Ram pickup (marketed as the Dodge Ram until 2010) is a full-size pickup truck manufactured by
                        Stellantis North America (formerly Chrysler Group LLC and FCA US LLC) and marketed from 2010
                        onwards under the Ram Trucks brand. Previously, Ram was part of the Dodge line of light trucks.
                        The name Ram was first used in 1981 model year Dodge Trucks in October 1980, following the
                        retiring and rebadging of the Dodge D series pickup trucks as well as B-series vans, though the
                        company had used a ram's-head hood ornament on some trucks as early as 1933.</p>
